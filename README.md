# MLflow Started Code

Welcome to the **MLflow Started Code** repository! This repository provides a hands-on example of how to use MLflow for tracking experiments, comparing models, and managing machine learning workflows. 

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Create and manage MLflow experiments.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models (Decision Tree and Random Forest).
- Log metrics, parameters, feature importances, and predictions.
- Save and load models using MLflow.

## Repository Structure

- **`run_experiments.py`**: Script to train models, log metrics, and save artifacts.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Dependencies for the project.
- **`results/`**: Directory where logs, model artifacts, and predictions will be saved.
